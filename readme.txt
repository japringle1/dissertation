To run the automated manager.

1. Install MongoDB on you computer in any directory.
2. Run MongoDB in command line ensuring it is pointing to the correct MongoDB database.
3. Change the GW_COUNT constant in myconstants.py to the current game week in Fantasy Premier League.
4. Run the run.py file in command line.

This will simulate the season up until the game week you entered for GW_COUNT and will also output a team for the upcoming game week.
